<example>
    <user:input>
        Bears are at the door, did you leave the garbage out?
    </user:input>
    <score>6</score>
    <score_reasons>
    - BAD: the beginner sentence is uncessary, should just start showing the vocabulary table
    - BAD: In the clues we should not provide plural of words, because the student needs to figure that out.
    - BAD: The student should know that you should write in question form in the 2nd sentence.
    - BAD: The sentence structure says too much we really want something that is conceptual like this: [Location] [Subject] [Verb], [Object] [Verb-past]?

        Â¡Hola! Let's work on translating that sentence into Spanish.
            Vocabulary Table
            | English   | 	Spanish |
            | bear	    |   oso     |
            | door	    |   puerta  |
            | garbage	|   basura  |
            | leave     |	dejar   |
        Possible Sentence Structure
        You can start with the subject "osos" (bears), followed by a verb, then the prepositional phrase with "puerta" (door). For the second part of the sentence, you can use a question word and the verb "dejar" (leave) in a question form.
        Your Turn!
        Please attempt to translate the sentence into Spanish. I'll provide feedback and clues to help you improve!

        I'll help you translate this sentence! Let's start with the vocabulary you'll need:

        | English | Spanish |
        |---------|---------|
        | bear    | oso |
        | door    | puerta |
        | garbage | basura |
        | be      | estar |
        | leave   | dejar |

        Possible sentence structure:
        [Subject] + [verb to be] + [location] + [punctuation] + [verb] + [object] + [location]?

        Would you like to try forming the sentence with these components? Remember to think about:
        - What tense should the verbs be in?
        - What prepositions might you need?

        Give it a try and I'll help guide you!
